    "# Project 3: Feature Selection + Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You're working as a data scientist with a research firm. You're firm is bidding on a big project that will involve working with thousands or possibly tens of thousands of features. You know it will be impossible to use conventional feature selection techniques. You propose that a way to win the contract is to demonstrate a capacity to identify relevant features using machine learning. Your boss says, \"Great idea. Write it up.\" You figure that working with a synthetic dataset such as [Madelon](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Madelon) is an excellent way to demonstrate your abilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "This work must be done on AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Your challenge here is to develop a series of models for two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. for the purposes of identifying relevant features. \n",
    "2. for the purposes of generating predictions from the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final product will consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A prepared report\n",
    "2. A series of Jupyter notebooks to be used to control your pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "You should do substantive work on at least six subsets of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- 3 sets of 10% of the data from the UCI Madelon set\n",
    "- 3 sets of 10% of the data from the Madelon set made available by your instructors (20000 rows, 1001 columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prepared Report\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. be a pdf\n",
    "2. include EDA of each subset \n",
    "   - EDA needs may be different depending upon subset or your approach to a solution\n",
    "3. present results from Step 1: Benchmarking\n",
    "4. present results from Step 2: Identify Salient Features\n",
    "5. present results from Step 3: Feature Importances\n",
    "6. present results from Step 4: Build Model\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Jupyter Notebook, EDA \n",
    "\n",
    "- perform EDA on each set as you see necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Jupyter Notebook, Step 1 - Benchmarking\n",
    "- build pipeline to perform a naive fit for each of the base model classes:\n",
    "\t- logistic regression\n",
    "\t- decision tree\n",
    "\t- k nearest neighbors\n",
    "\t- support vector classifier\n",
    "- in order to do this, you will need to set a high `C` value in order to perform minimal regularization, in the case of logistic regression and support vector classifier.  An example is 1E10\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Jupyter Notebook, Step 2 - Identify Features\n",
    "- Build feature selection pipelines using at least three different techniques\n",
    "- **NOTE**: these pipelines are being used for feature selection not prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Jupyter Notebook, Step 3 - Feature Importance\n",
    "- Use the results from step 2 to discuss feature importance in the dataset\n",
    "- Considering these results, develop a strategy for building a final predictive model\n",
    "- recommended approaches:\n",
    "    - Use feature selection to reduce the dataset to a manageable size then use conventional methods\n",
    "    - Use dimension reduction to reduce the dataset to a manageable size then use conventional methods\n",
    "    - Use an iterative model training method to use the entire dataset\n",
    "   \n",
    "##### Jupyter Notebook, Step 4 - Build Model\n",
    "- Implement your final model\n",
    "- (Optionally) use the entire data set\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "- A written report of your findings that detail the accuracy and assumptions of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document **everything**.\n",
